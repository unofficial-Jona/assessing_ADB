Detecting Aggressive Driving Behaviour in Videos using Transformer models

Dataset: https://gamma.umd.edu/researchdirections/autonomousdriving/meteor/

Transformer models like SWIN Video Transformer show outstanding performance in the domaion of video classification. 
The scope of this project is to develop a working prototype, with competetive performance. In a second step said prototype should be extended to deliver usefull explainations as to why a certain classification was made.
